<p>Dear yourself,</p>

<p>My name is Mark Conway. I am one of Damian Conway's illegitimate sons, the
very famous Perl hacker who bringed tons of great crazy Perl modules.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Damian, as you are aware, has been trampled by a Camel on a
holiday to egypt. However, I had the surprise of being sent a letter from
Damian. Not forgetting his secret son.</p>

<p>Damian left me the incredible amounts of FIFTY MILLION LINES OF OBFUSCATED
PERL CODE (OPC 50,000,000.00) so that I can be seen as a great hacker and get
some acknowledgement too.</p>

<p>However I currently cannot publish this code because of USA and European
patent law. Since you live in Nigeria, I would request your cooperation for a
mutually profitable business.</p>

<p>The operation would proceed as follows:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>CPAN Account</dt>
  <dd>You give me your CPAN account username and password</dd>

  <dt>Login</dt>
  <dd>I log in CPAN as you</dd>

  <dt>Upload</dt>
  <dd>I remove all the code from... euh... I upload the FIFTY MILLION LINES OF OBFUSCATED
PERL CODE (OPC 50,000,000.00) in your CPAN account</dd>

  <dt>Which gives...</dt>
  <dd>Fame!</dd>
</dl>

<p>Of course, as a compensation, I will subscribe myself as a module co-author,
effectively grabbing about half the fame you'll get for these modules. Which
will still leave you a whopping TWENTY FIVE MILLION LINES OF OBFUSCATED PERL
CODE (OPC 25,000,000.00)</p>

<pre>-- 
Yours Faithfully,
Mark Damian, Illegitimate Son</pre>
